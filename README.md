# java_calculator
While I was learning Applets, I tried out my own way, tried to create a calculator on my own. Currently, it does only simple functions, like
add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponent and log.
The main goal would be to make this a proper scientific calculator :)
The part used right now, are simply buttons, labels and text fields.
2 textfields are used as input, a and b (its that basic, yes)
another textfield is used for storing the answer.
The buttons use the ActionPerformed and ActionEvent classes of java, overriding the actionPerformed method, and employing the logic required.
The readme is also not that well docmented right now, Sorry for that!
Am currently in between my semester exams, and wanted to keep up the commits(:P)
Hope you like it!
Instructions for using the applet:
You need : 
1)Java version 8 (it got decremented in the newer versions. Now, we use JavaFX an Swing)
2)Command prompt
On the command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the files (find out your command for your OS) , type the following command:
>>javac calci.java (compiling the program)
>>appletviewer calci.html (running it on html)
and a small window will pop up
